My throbber is really simple. It consist of some elements rotating in the center of the screen. The throbber is able to change appearance according to the location of the mouse. The y-axis determine if the throbber is made of ellipses, rectangles or quads, and the x-axis control if the color of the throbber is blue, green, pink or purple.  I have used "if-statements” and boolean expressions to create this appearance change. 

I have used the boolean expressions to create something that may change the user's focus from waiting on a program to load, to wanting to explore the different ways that the throbber can look. When the user focuses on changing the look of the throbber, they forget that they are waiting for something to load, and when the loading is finished, the time has gone by faster, because they were having some kind of fun playing with the throbber. 
The user can only discover the changing possibilities, if they move the mouse while the program is loading. If they don’t, then their perception of time won’t differ compared to other throbbers. 

A throbber is a signal telling the user that the program is loading, and that they just have to wait for a moment. The throbber is only telling us that we have to wait, and it neglects to inform the user about the amount of waiting time. We live in a society where we want everything to be quick and fast, and we don’t want to waste our time waiting to long for something to load. If the throbber informed the user about the remaining time, the user would maybe choose to stop the loading, because it is taking to long, and therefor deciding that isn’t that important after all. When the user don’t know for how long they have to wait, they are more likely to stay around, because the program could stop loading at any point, and they don’t want to close a program, if they perhaps is cancelling the download 2 seconds before it is finished. 

People do not like to see the throbber because it is associated with waiting, and not knowing what is happening. Because the throbber is a part of our digital life, we need to be more positive about it. Somehow the user has to associate the throbber icon, with something good or something fun.
