I don’t know how much of a game my work is. It wasn’t my intention to create a game, but I wanted to  create something were my focus was on creating and understanding classes. 
The background of my work is black, but when you click on the background a circle in a random size and color appears. Every time you click, a new circle appear. All the circles move the same way, and in the same tempo. When the circles hit the end of the screen, they appear again, and this time they appear in a total random place. 

For my work I have created one class called Circle, and a variable that consist of an array called circles. I have created a function called mouseClicked, and told it to create a circle when the user is pressing the mouse. When I created the class, I used constructor to create some values, that i defined in the mouseClicked function. I used the syntax Random to give the circles different colors. 
I created a forloop, consisting of the function move and show, which are defined at the bottom of the code. In move I created some boolean expressions, to keep the circles moving in the screen, after they have reached the end. I used the syntax Random, so that the circles would appear at different places on the screen. 

Object-oriented programming are characterized by the ability to create and structure the code by objects. Here you gather all information about an object at the same place, and this makes it easier to manage and create better and more effective objects. All objects are a part of a class, and the objects in this class shares a lot of the same attributes and methods. 
It is possible to create a lot of objects that looks similar, but can be a bit different compared to each other, in just a couple of lines of code. 

It has just been International women’s day, and websites as Facebook has promoted this, by sharing inspiring quotes about empowering women, and they praise all the women in the world. But still, the Facebook cooperation and other big corporations, doesn’t have a lot of women in their top positions. I can’t help but think it as quite ironic that a company mainly run by men, is using a day like that to tell women that they can do whatever that want, and that they deserve it, but they just wont hire them, nor recognize that women easily can run a company just as good as men can. I think that these companies are using days like this to hide the fact that they are in lack of women in the higher positions. 

I don’t really know how to connect my program to a digital context. Maybe you could say something about that you don’t know what is there unless you explore it?
