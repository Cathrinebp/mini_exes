Cathrine: 

Our program shows two different quotes and statements at the same time. The top line is a quote spoken by a famous feminist, and the bottom line is a Donald trump quote. Each line chooses randomly between 5 different quotes. 

Our idea with this program was to show how disrespectful Donald Trump is towards women, and how he fails to empower them. Our original idea for this program was to show a feminist statement, to which trump would come with an answer, consisting of something he has once said. But we had some trouble programming this, so we went with this program, where the quotes is generated by a framerate. 

Our program doesn’t create its own sentences, but it does create its own combinations of the quotes. The syntax in our program tells the program which sentences it has to show, and where these should be shown. 
Our program has no idea what is behind these words, and why they were once spoken. The program doesnt know that some of the quotes supports and empowers women, while the other quotes is spoken by a president, who generally is condescending towards women. 
But still, the user is most likely to know who Trump is, and they have properly also heard phrases as “grab them by the pussy” before. This use, gives the program some personality, and helps it embrase the differences between the statements. 


Helena: 

When the program runs you will see two pictures; one of the American president Donald Trump and one of two business looking women. Above the women quotes with feminist statements runs and changes according to the framerate and the same happens under the face of Donald Trump, just with sexist statements about women, that he made himself.

The idea of the program is to make it (even more) obvious what nonsense Trump is speaking. Originally, we tried to do this by making the program create sentences by putting those two kinds of contradictory phrases together. This was not possible for us to code, though. So, we came up with this speech balloon -ish idea where Trumps statements end up seeming like a kind of rejection.
 
Even though our code does not really have expressive qualities other than the technical ones, it is still interesting to consider the fact that the computer understands the syntax of the code and executes this into a program, but it does not understand the strong opinion, content and history of ex. “grab them by the pussy”.
The program does not have a voice itself, but you can still argue that the sentences are written speech. First, because they are quotes of things spoken in the past and second, because it is difficult to read the trump sentences without hearing his voice speaking them in your head. Thereby the program is being added a different kind ‘consciousness’ where the fact that everything the program does has been thought of and created by humans, is much more transparent than if the computer would speak the words itself. But if the program had had its ‘own’ voice most people would be more likely to perceive the program as an individual with its own consciousness. As Geoff and McLean puts it; "computer programs have bodies in the sense that other materialities and meanings are deeply interwoven, and these necessarily exist as part of wider social relations", meaning that the program becomes alive because what it expresses is understood by us, and therefor has an effect on us.
